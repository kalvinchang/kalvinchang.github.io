I am a speech researcher who aims to build support for non-standard, low-resource language varieties. I have a track record of publication in top NLP and speech conferences, with a portfolio of 7 co-first authored publications across ASR, NLP, and computational linguistics. My work in both computational historical linguistics and low-resource speech recognition uniquely positions me to pursue my research agenda, which takes the unconventional approach of applying insights from historical linguistics to boost low-resource speech recognition.

I am currently a Visiting Scholar in [Shinji Watanabe](https://wavlab.org) and [David Mortensen](https://changelinglab.github.io)'s labs at Carnegie Mellon, leading two teams working on speech in-context learning for low-resource dialects and on language-universal phone recognition. I graduated with a Master's of Language Technologies (Rank 1) and a BS in Computer Science (with University Honors) from CMU.
