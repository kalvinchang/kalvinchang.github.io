I am an incoming CS PhD at [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu) and [Berkeley NLP](https://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu), advised by [Alane Suhr](https://www.alanesuhr.com). My research aims to build data-efficient approaches to learn the long tail of language variation in both text and speech. I have a track record of publication in top NLP and speech conferences, with a portfolio of 7 co-first authored publications across ASR, NLP, and computational linguistics. 

I was fortunate to work on computational linguistics and speech processing with [David Mortensen](https://changelinglab.github.io) and [Shinji Watanabe](https://wavlab.org) at Carnegie Mellon, where I graduated with a Master's of Language Technologies (Rank 1) and a BS in Computer Science (with University Honors) from CMU.
