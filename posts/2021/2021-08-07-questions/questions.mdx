Hi. I'm compiling a list of open questions that I have yet to resolve:

* Why is the eng sound in 朋友 (péng yǒu) pronounced different than that of 風 (fēng)?
* How do native speakers of a language internalize morphological rules and tone sandhi? Taiwanese has 7 tones and a LOT of tone changes.
* How did Old Chinese evolve into Hokkien and Mandarin Chinese?
* How does language change? Is it decided by a bunch of old people inside an academy or official institute? Or is it decided by people over time who consciously decide which parts to keep? Or is
  language change happen organically as people subconsciously change certain sounds, morphemes, meanings, or syntax?
