AP Chem
  * If you do not vibe with your teacher's teaching style, here are a solid series of lectures on AP Chem
  * https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVqkjsKI25jyakiVhTrQhESUKg1eOsSsL
  * I got a 5 by taking notes on her lectures


AP Calculus AB
  * If you are self studying Calculus AB, I recommend Rita Korsunky's powerpoints
  * They're pretty cute and interactive
  * https://books.apple.com/us/book/ap-calculus-interactive-lectures-vol-1/id553360181
  * Recently, though, I've heard good reviews about Khan Academy's course
  * After learning all of the content, practice the released FRQs on College Board's website
  * It's basically 考古題 (practicing old questions), unfortunately


AP English Language
  * I recommend writing practice essays on your own for each type of essay.
  * Look at the college board samples and why the top essays got the scores. Jot down the specific techniques they used.
  * For the argumentative essay, it's easier to demonstrate deeper critical thinking by qualifying instead of taking one side.
  * Avoid the Jane Schafer five paragraph essay to show that your writing is not basic. 
  * I personally asked my AP Lang teacher after class for feedback on these practice essays.
  * For reading comprehension, just practice timing yourself while taking practice exams. Admittedly, this is pretty hard to improve overnight. When I was preparing for standardized tests,
    I began to read the New York Times to improve my reading comprehension score, which was my weakest. I'm not sure how much it helped, though. 


AP Computer Science A
  * I personally learned Java from Intro to Java Programming by Daniel Liang, but this textbook may be too heavy for your liking.
  * I self-studied the rest from Barron's and practiced free response, which was enough to get a 5 (at least back then). 
  * Make sure you can do these basic tasks (source: https://cscheerleader.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fall-2013-apcs-inservice1.pdf)
    * extract digits from an integer
    * check consecutive elements in an array/ArrayList
    * accumulate values in an array/ArrayList
    * average elements in an array/ArrayList
    * find the max/min of an array/ArrayList
    * find the index of the max/min of an array/ArrayList
    * how to expand an array
    * reverse items in an array
    * remove items from an ArrayList
    * search for an element in an array/ArrayList using linear search
    * sort an array using selection sort
    * how to traverse a 2D array from multiple directions


AP Physics 1
  * I personally do not recommend taking this because you do not get college credit, and it is notoriously difficult to get a 5, as the test is more conceptual than calculation-based.
  * I recommend just skipping into AP Physics C, which is more calculation-based. 
  * Also, learning physics with calculus is more intuitive, as calculus was invented for physics, if I recall correctly.
