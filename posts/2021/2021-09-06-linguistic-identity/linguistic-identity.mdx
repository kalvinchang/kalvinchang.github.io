I wrote this for a personal introduction in 80-287 Language Variation and Change. 
The purpose of publishing the introduction here is to share how I got interested in 
linguistics recently. 

### My academic perspective

In fall 2020, I took Language Diversity and Cultural Identity and recalled many interesting moments from my own experiences with Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Hokkien in my childhood and in the twelve months I spent in Taiwan during the pandemic. Naturally, I began to watch YouTube videos on not just Sinitic dialectology but also how other languages came to be, such as how Malay was heavily influenced by Arabic because of the spread of Islam to Malaysia and Indonesia. Admittedly, I am not well informed on many issues because Wikipedia, YouTube, and Quora have been my main sources, so I seek to formally learn historical linguistics. I am interested in learning how Old Chinese transformed in Middle Chinese and branched off into all of the mutually unintelligible languages of the Sinitic language family, such as Mandarin and Hokkien. I am also curious about how Hokkien contains many words similar to Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. I still remember in high school how another Taiwanese friend, who also enjoyed watching Kdramas, told me that “really” in Korean is jinjja and tsin-tsiànn in Taiwanese Hokkien. I dismissed this phenomenon as a pure coincidence, because Quora (yes, I’m ashamed too) told me that Korean and the Sinitic languages were from different language families, and that claims that Korean descended from Chinese were just examples of Han chauvinism. What I did not realize was that even though Korean and the Sinitic languages are from different language families, Korean did borrow many loanwords from Chinese at the time, which was closer to Hokkien than Mandarin Chinese. Through this class, I seek to learn the specific processes by which other languages adapt words from other languages into their own. Finally, I also want to learn how dialects come into being. How is it possible for variants to form just in the neighboring village? For instance, my grandfather told me if you walk over to a nearby village in his ancestral home of Henan Province, China, the people will speak a slightly different version of his mother tongue, Henanese. This class will probably not directly address Sinitic dialectology, but I am sure I will be well equipped to read the historical linguistics textbooks and literature surrounding this topic by the end of the semester. 


### My linguistic identity

I was born and raised in the largest Taiwanese American community in the U.S., Los Angeles. At home, my parents and I spoke Mandarin 90 percent of the time, and they mostly watched Taiwanese news networks and variety shows. I probably watched CTi (a news network) before CNN. I wondered as a kid, why didn’t my family speak Taiwanese if they were born in Taiwan? Part of the answer is that my paternal grandfather fled from mainland China to Taiwan with the KMT during the Chinese Civil War, so his native language is Mandarin Chinese (well, Henanese to be precise, but Henanese is a variant of Mandarin). The majority of Han Taiwanese, however, spoke Taiwanese Hokkien or Hakka as their mother tongues, both of which are in the Sinitic language family but are not mutually intelligible with Mandarin. This is because their ancestors arrived from Fujian or Guangdong, China centuries ago. Today Mandarin is the dominant language as a result of the KMT’s policies that promoted Mandarin and penalized Hokkien, though in recent years, the government has promoted mother tongue education. From my experience learning about the history of Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien, I realized that when learning a language, one must also learn the historical, social, and cultural context of the language. 

From my experiences learning Mandarin at an afterschool program, I also learned that Mandarin is not homogeneous. I realized that the textbook we used was teaching the Beijing dialect (most prominently characterized by erhua, which involves adding -er to the end of many words). I also realized that my family and I tended to soften our retroflex consonants, for instance, chī fàn (to eat) would sound like cī fàn. Was the Mandarin I spoke at home just wrong? Then again, it felt weird to use the tones and pronunciation promoted by the textbook with my family; I would sound overly proper and create distance. I learned in college that we actually spoke Taiwanese Mandarin, a variant of Mandarin that is heavily influenced by Hokkien. Nowadays, my Mandarin is leaving behind the so-called ABC (American-born Chinese) accent and approaching full on Taiwanese Mandarin–a process accelerated by staying in Taiwan for twelve months during the pandemic. However, when speaking over Facetime to my grandfather who is originally from China, I tend to speak proper Mandarin because his hearing is deteriorating and I worry that he will not be able to hear Taiwanese Mandarin clearly (Yes, this is an actual concern, as people have complained about Taiwanese singer Jay Chou’s failure to enunciate his consonants.). Similarly, when speaking English to my mother, I tend to not use Standard American English in favor of accented English. I remember reading that Amy Tan, author of Joy Luck Club, did the same. I am not sure if I started doing so because of her or because it is natural to mimic the accent of your surroundings. 

My experiences learning Taiwanese Hokkien have also introduced me to issues of dialectal variation. Of my four grandparents, only my maternal grandmother spoke Hokkien, so my mother and her side of the family are the only people who speak Hokkien. Because my cousin and I only learned Mandarin and English, my mother and my aunt would hide their secrets in Hokkien. My other encounters with this language involve the food we ate at restaurants. In elementary school, I asked my mother how to write bah-uân (meatball) in Mandarin. She replied that bah-uân is not Mandarin; it’s Hokkien. I doubted her for a second because I remembered seeing the Chinese characters on the menu. However, what she was trying to get at was that Taiwanese is a spoken language and is not written. I learned recently that Taiwanese Hokkien, despite being mostly spoken and not written for most Taiwanese, can actually be written using Han characters, though many scholars debate which are the most faithful representations. I later realized that our family refers to many other foods by their Hokkien name as well. It has been an interesting experience to recall these foods and try to guess the corresponding Chinese characters. This past summer, I picked up a Hokkien book and significantly increased my vocabulary. Though my mother often asks me to switch back to Mandarin because my tones (of which there are seven in Hokkien!) are often wrong. To be clear, Taiwanese Hokkien is not my mother tongue (Mandarin Chinese is) because most of my family does not have Hokkien heritage. I am learning Hokkien though because of its cultural capital in Taiwan. While speaking with some older family members, family friends, and aunties at markets, Hokkien is used. Hokkien is also resurging in popularity in local pop music, which young people will for sure sing on karaoke nights. However, I am careful not to use Hokkien with my grandfather, who does not speak nor understand it. While watching Tiger Tail on Netflix with him, he stopped watching a few minutes into the film when the characters spoke Taiwanese. Though there were Mandarin subtitles, he did not want to watch further, dismissing the film as propaganda. In my grandfather’s case, Hokkien reminded him of his previous status as an outsider in his new home. Another interesting phenomenon while learning from the textbook is that after each lesson, I would have to ask my mother which one of the two variants of a particular term her family used. My family speaks the northern dialect of Taiwanese, but the southern dialect is the prestige dialect. When I bought my first Hokkien book in sixth grade, I would have to tediously ask a family friend for his pronunciation of a particular term, which differed from the southern one presented in the book. Fortunately, the most recent book I bought presents both dialects. 

In short, my experiences with Mandarin and Taiwanese have exposed me to issues in sociolinguistics and dialectology.
