## üìù Using and modifying this starter

This starter creates a new Gatsby site that installs and configures the theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog).

Have a look at the theme's README and files to see what options are available and how you can shadow the various components including Theme UI. Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/` to shadow/override files. The Theme UI config can be configured by shadowing its files in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/`.

### Adding content

#### Adding a new blog post

New blog posts will be shown on the index page (the three most recent ones) of this theme and on the blog overview page. They can be added by creating MDX files inside `content/posts`. General setup:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/posts`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Add images to the created folder (from step 1) you want to reference in your blog post
1. Reference an image as your `banner` in the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md

title: Introduction to "Defence against the Dark Arts"
date: 2019-11-07
description: Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) is a subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
tags:
  - Tutorial
  - Dark Arts
banner: ./defence-against-the-dark-arts.jpg
---
```

**The fields `description` and `banner` are optional!** If no description is provided, an excerpt of the blog post will be used. If no banner is provided, the default `siteImage` (from `siteMetadata`) is used.

The `date` field has to be written in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`!

#### Adding a new page

Additional pages can be created by placing MDX files inside `contents/pages`, e.g. an "About" or "Contact" page. You'll manually need to link to those pages, for example by adding them to the navigation (in `navigation` option of the theme). General instructions:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/pages`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter
1. Optionally add files/images to the folder you want to reference from the page

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md
---
title: About
slug: "/about"
---
```

#### Changing the "Hero" text

To edit the hero text ("Hi, I'm Lupin...), create a file at `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/texts/hero.mdx` to edit the text.

#### Changing the "Projects" part

To edit the projects part below "Latest posts", create a file at `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/texts/bottom.mdx` to edit the contents.

### Change your `static` folder

The `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and robots.txt. Don't forget to change these files, too!
